the same buttens will be presented as in the victory UI and you will also se a resume buttun and when presed will unpause the game so you can continue.


in the main menu there is alo a quit button that will shut down the game but it only works in a build and not in the unity edditor.

i struktured my code so that things that control simular things ore are conected to the same object are together and not spread out, and why i did it is so its easyer to find somthing that whey.


sorces:
the only sorce i used in this project was a granede tutorial from brakise to learn how to push enything away from the player the rest of the code i knew befor making the game.
